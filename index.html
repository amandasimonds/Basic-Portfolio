        <p>Front-End Web Developer with a background in art education, passionate about helping people and creating beautifully intuitive and inspiring user experiences on the web.</p>
        <p>Recently earned a certificate in Full Stack Development from University of Denver. Freshly learned skills in JavaScript, CSS, HTML, ReactJS, CSS frameworks, MySQL and MongoDB, and responsive web design.</p> 
        <p>A creative problem-solver, I intend to engage audiences of different abilities in achieving goals and being educated through effective user experiences. In my team projects, I combined my skills as a web developer with my background in education to create these types of programs.
            One of these projects, <a href="https://oceanport.herokuapp.com/">SpacePort</a>, is an app that gives the user a fun, bright experience browsing resources about Space. We designed the interface to draw people in and make learning fun. 
            In addition to SpacePort, we created a sister app, <a href="https://oceanport.herokuapp.com/">OceanPort</a>, that also engages users in learning, through a variety of interactions. Utilizing my experience with children, I created the user badge system, to keep track of progress and achievements. My goal is to make learning as fun and interactive as possible</p> 
        <br><p>Inspired by my experience in education, and passionate about problem-solving and coding, I am excited to work with more innovative people to build fun and educational experiences on the web.
