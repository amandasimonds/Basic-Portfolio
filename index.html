        <p>I am an elementary art teacher, currently enrolled in University of Denver's Fullstack Developer Bootcamp, with a projected graduation date of March, 2020.</p>
        <p>With my new skills in front end and back end coding, I hope to assist in developing programs that push the standard of "user-friendly", that are seemless and intuitive to use.
            I aim to use my background in art and education to work on applications for learning. From working with children, I am also interested in educational programs based on gaming.

        <p>Baltimore, MD is my hometown, where I grew up and went to college. I graduated from Maryland Institute College of Art with a BFA in General Fine Arts in 2014, and 
            a Masters of Arts in Education in 2015. I have been living and teaching in Denver for the past 2 years, and intend to pursue my new career here after I graduate.
